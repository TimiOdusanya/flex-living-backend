# Flex Living Reviews Dashboard - Technical Documentation

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive Reviews Dashboard system for Flex Living, consisting of a Node.js/Express.js backend API and a Next.js frontend application. The system allows property managers to manage guest reviews, approve/reject reviews for public display, and analyze property performance through an intuitive dashboard interface.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Technology Stack Selection

**Backend:**
- **Express.js**: Chosen for its simplicity and flexibility
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and better developer experience
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication suitable for API services
- **In-memory Storage**: Used for demo purposes, easily replaceable with database

**Frontend:**
- **Next.js 15**: Latest version with App Router for better performance
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS for rapid development
- **ShadCN/UI**: High-quality, accessible component library
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management solution
- **Framer Motion**: Professional animation library

### 2. API Design Philosophy

**RESTful Design:**
- Clear resource-based URLs
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH)
- Consistent response format with success/error indicators
- Proper HTTP status codes

**Response Format:**
```typescript
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  message?: string;
}
```

### 3. Data Normalization Strategy

**Review Data Structure:**
- Unified interface for all review sources (Hostaway, Google, etc.)
- Consistent rating scale (1-10) across all categories
- Standardized date formats and property identification
- Channel-specific metadata preservation

**Category Mapping:**
```typescript
interface ReviewCategories {
  cleanliness: number;
  communication: number;
  respect_house_rules: number;
  check_in: number;
  value: number;
  location: number;
}
```

### 4. Authentication & Authorization

**JWT Implementation:**
- Secure token-based authentication
- Role-based access control (Admin/Manager)
- Token expiration handling
- Protected route middleware

**Security Measures:**
- Password hashing with bcryptjs
- CORS configuration for frontend access
- Helmet for security headers
- Input validation and sanitization

## API Behaviors

### 1. Hostaway Integration

**Implementation:**
- Mock data fallback when API is unavailable
- Real API integration with proper error handling
- Data normalization for consistent frontend consumption
- Rate limiting consideration for production

**Mock Data Strategy:**
- Realistic review data with varied ratings
- Multiple property types and locations
- Different review channels and statuses
- Time-based data for trend analysis

### 2. Google Places Integration

**Exploration Results:**
- Successfully integrated Google Places API
- Place search and details retrieval
- Review data extraction and normalization
- Mock implementation for development

**Implementation Details:**
```typescript
// Google Places API integration
async getPlaceDetails(placeId: string): Promise<GooglePlaceResult | null> {
  const response = await axios.get(`${this.baseUrl}/details/json`, {
    params: {
      place_id: placeId,
      key: this.apiKey,
      fields: 'place_id,name,rating,user_ratings_total,reviews,formatted_address,geometry'
    }
  });
  return response.data.result || null;
}
```

### 3. Review Management Workflow

**Approval Process:**
1. Reviews are fetched from various sources
2. Managers can filter and search reviews
3. Individual review approval/rejection
4. Approved reviews appear on public property pages
5. Real-time dashboard updates

**Filtering Capabilities:**
- By property ID
- By rating range
